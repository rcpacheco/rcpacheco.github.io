###Motivation

This blog contains information regardin my peronal interests. I share the code in this repositories with the intention to contribute back to the open source community.

I will publish the work under an MIT licence so that you can use freely the code. 

 
###[100DaysOfCode](https://github.com/rcpacheco/100-days-of-code).

I've been coding proffesionally in many languages since 1990. I enjoy this activity because  it offers a great oportunity to represent and better manage the complexity of our world. Developing supply chain models has been the main  goal of my work during most of those years.

I have enjoyed specially developing in "traditional" languages like Java, perl, php, C#, JavaScript, but have been enchanted by the simplicity of the languages like Scheme and the sturdiness or Erlang.

One languaje that I have admired since the early 90's when I had the chance to learn it at MIT in Bosto, is the powerfull G2 by Gensym, with its powerfule rule engine and visual capabilities, it introduced me to live programming.

Looking for proven concepts that could bring our customers great tools wile allowing our work teams to be a creative and productive, I approched Pharo SmallTalk. Simple is beautiful, but having a beautiful interface and an interesting concept to manage the development process has attracted me to get to know @freenkcom #gtoolkit.

Therefore I decided to take the challenge to dive deep into this developemt platform and the Example Driven Development paradigm.
Adopting new paradigms and learn new programming languages  presents challenges even in the simple tasks.
I will try to document my findings as well as the advices that I may receive in the process, for my team to take advantage of from my journey, but also to make the transition to this paradigm easier for others.
